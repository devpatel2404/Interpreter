This is a C++ Projects Based partly on The Book Crafting Interpreters
Although I am using a Book all of the code will be mine, I am only using the books as a reference to what i need to do.

Snippets:
Int x = 64;
String s = "hello";
Int z = INT_MAX;
String b = " world";
String greeting = s + b;
Print(greeting);
Print("hello.txt", greeting);
int filefd = openFile("Greeting.txt", WRITE | CREATE | TRUNCATE);
Print(filefd, greeting);
